# UpTask Model-View-Controller
This project is a dashboard for task management where a user can register and create projects. Each project has a task list with various states (to do, doing, done, etc.). It is a useful tool for project development, providing a visual control of the tasks that need to be done.

The website is built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, utilizing a router to invoke relevant functions. Each URL is associated with a function in a class. This function performs necessary operations, and the data obtained from this processing (Controller) is sent to a router function called 'render' to display the associated view (View).

Sass (enhances css workflow) and Composer (package management in PHP) have been used as development tools.
